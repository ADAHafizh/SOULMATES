## SOULMATES - The Only Way Out Is Together!

### Overview
"Soulmates" is exclusively a two-player game, designed for both players to engage simultaneously on a single computer. The primary objective of the game is to foster teamwork and cooperative problem-solving as players guide the souls through their journey, discovering their identities and stories.

### Player Controls
* Player 1: Controls their character using the arrow keys.
* Player 2: Controls their character using the WASD keys.

This control scheme emphasizes the game's focus on teamwork and communication, as players must coordinate their actions closely to solve puzzles and advance the story. The dual-player mode is essential for the narrative and mechanics of "Soulmates". Players are encouraged to work together in real-time, making decisions that affect the game's outcome. This setup enhances the game's thematic elements of companionship and togetherness, providing a unique interactive experience. This is central to the concept of "Soulmates", ensuring players can experience the full depth of the game's cooperative and storytelling potential.

### Why Play "Soulmates"?
"Soulmates" offers players a unique blend of engaging puzzles and a compelling story. It emphasizes the importance of love, companionship, and selflessness, providing a rich, cooperative gaming experience.

### Process and Implementation
The development of "Soulmates" started by defining a clear vision: to create a cooperative puzzle-solving game that emphasized storytelling. The core idea was to intertwine the game mechanics with the narrative, making each puzzle a part of the unfolding story about two souls discovering their past. Cooperation is mandatory, with puzzles that cannot be solved by players acting independently. This enforces the theme of togetherness and mutual dependence. The game is set in a limbo-like world, chosen for its symbolic representation of the characters' state — between their past lives and their potential redemption. This setting supports the narrative. The decision was influenced by the desire to create a space that felt both mysterious and engaging, encouraging exploration and cooperation.

### Challenges Encountered:
* Complexity of Puzzles: Some feedback indicated that certain puzzles might have been too complex or not intuitive enough, occasionally leading to player frustration rather than collaboration. This highlighted a potential misalignment between puzzle difficulty and player expectations.
* Technical Limitations: Our initial ambition to include more dynamic interactions and a richer environmental storytelling was somewhat difficult to implement due technical and time constraints.
